## Overview 
This project is a study for the CityBike data in New York to duplicate the same project in Des Moines. We will use the analytic tool Tableau to produce visualization and a story to answer the main questions for this analysis. 

## Results
In the following results we will be designing data visualizations for several aspects: 
### Who rides Citybikes? 

This heatmap is displaying the riders by types and gender as well as the count of riders by weekdays. This data indicates that subscribers especially male use the service more often during the week.  Also, the graph shows a breakdown of annual subscribers vs. short-term customers

### When is the peak?  


The following view display the peak hours on average day and heat map for the week. Overall, rides are higher during the day, from about 8am to 7pm. The second chart is displaying the use by days of the week, which reveals distinct peaks around rush hours on weekdays.

### How long are the rides? 


These representations display the duration of rides by gender. The results reveals that nearly all trips are shorter than about 40 minutes. In the other hand, most trips are shorter than 15 minutes with most male users. 

### Where is top start and drop locations? 


The maps show the top starting and ending locations. This indicate where customers are beginning and ending their bike rental journeys, which is located mainly in Manhattan. 

## Summary

In summary, we can resume that the majority of CitiBike users are subscribers, and most of all users are male. Users tend to use CitiBikes to commute within the city, indicated by the peak times around 8am and 5pm on weekdays. 
Des Moines is quite different, this distribution may be very specific and only applies to New York City. 
Giving this dataset I will also think about visualizing the age of users and the duration of rides by age:
